  PagerDuty users are members of a PagerDuty account that have the ability to interact with incidents and other data on the account.

  Users are fundamental agents of different types of actions in PagerDuty. A user can, among other things:
  * acknowlege, reassign, snooze, escalate, and resolve incidents
  * configure services, escalation policies, integrations, on-call schedules, teams, and more
  * go on call for one or more schedules or escalation policies
  * receive notifications

  Depending on a user's role, he or she may have access to different parts of the account's data.
